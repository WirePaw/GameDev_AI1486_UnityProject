- "Can..." = reacts on outside interaction (controller-input, other object-collider, etc.)
- "Will..." = acts on their own (time of action described in name)
	- "...at start" = acts at start of the scene

Exceptions:
- AudioManager
- AnimationManager
- LevelManager
- PlayerManager
- EnemyManager


- "AnimationBehaviour" = managaes sprite animation, orientation, etc.
	- doesn't react on other objects
	- requires full spritesheet (or folder?) to provide animation


reworked scripts:

- PlayerManager
	- CanBeControlled
	- WillSpawnAtStart
